    "# Using GST to test for context dependence\n",
    "This example shows how to introduce new gate labels into a GST analysis so as to test for context dependence.  In particular, we'll look at the 1-qubit X, Y, I gateset.  Suppose a usual GST analysis cannot fit the model well, and that we think this is due to the fact that a \"Gi\" gate which immediately follows a \"Gx\" gate is affected by some residual noise that isn't otherwise present.  In this case, we can model the system as having two different \"Gi\" gates: \"Gi\" and \"Gi2\", and model the \"Gi\" gate as \"Gi2\" whenever it follows a \"Gx\" gate."
