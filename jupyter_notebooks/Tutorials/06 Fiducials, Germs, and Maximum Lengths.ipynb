    "# Fiducials, Germs, and Max-Lengths (oh my!)\n",
    "While pyGSTi allows one to create arbitrary lists of gate strings, the GST algorithms have been designed to work well with gate sequences that have a particular structure.  At the beginning and the end of each string are \"preparation fiducial\" and \"measurement fiducial\" sequences, respectively, whose purpose is to extend the native preparation and measurment operations to informationally complete sets.  In between the fiducial sequences is a \"germ\" sequence, or just \"germ\", that is repeated some number of times.  The purpose of the repeated-germ sequence is to amplify one or more particular types of errors.  By considering an entire set of germs (called an \"amplificationally complete\" set), *all* possible types of errors are amplified, giving the GST algorithms high sensitivity to all errors.  The longer the sequences, that is, the more repetitions of the germs, the higher the sensitivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While this may seem to imply that one should just to incredibly long sequences, there are several caveats.\n",
    "1) Because the gates are imperfect, there is some practical length (possibly germ-dependent) at which the initial state is so depolarized that it cannot be distinguished from the maximally-mixed state.  This sets an upper bound on the length of useful gate sequences.\n",
    "2) Because GST's numerical algorithms use local gradient-based optimization methods, starting with seqeunces of maximal length would often result in getting trapped in a local minima of the function being optimized (often the likelihood).  The GST algorithms iterate through multiple gate string lists, using the result of the previous iteration to seed the next one.  When gate sequences lists are chosen well they are able guide the GST optimization to a global (or near-global) maximum by *gradually* making the objective function sharper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, well-chosen lists of gate sequences can be formed as follows.  First, we defne an increasing sequence of **maximum-lengths**, usually powers of 2, e.g. `[1,2,4,8,16,...]`, which terminates with the longest useful sequence length.  Secondly, we select preparation- and measurement-fiducial `GateString` lists, and a list of germ sequences.  These lists are chosen such that the fiducial sequences result in informationally complete preparations and measurements, and the germs are amplificationally complete.  For each maximum-length $L$, the set of all\n",
    "\n",
    "`preparation_fiducial + repeated_germ + measurement_fiducial`\n",
    "\n",
    "sequences, where `preparation_fiducial` ranges over all preparation fiducials, `measurement_fiducial` ranges over all measurement fiducials, and `repeated_germ` ranges over all the germs *repeated such that the length of `repeated_germ` does not exceed $L$*.  To further increase the robustness of the numerics, the gate string list corresponding to $L$ will also contain all of the sequences from earlier (lower) values of $L$.  This procedure thus creates a list of gate strings for each $L$ that are designed for use by pyGSTi's \"long-sequence\" GST algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fiducial and germ lists are obtained by pyGSTi's \"fiducial selection\" and \"germ selection\" algorithms, as detailed in a later tutorial.  This this tutorial we'll be using one of pyGSTi's \"standard\" gate sets, for which fiducial and germ sequences are pre-computed:"

    "## Why settle for lists, when you can have structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "While a list-of-lists such as `lsgst_lists` is all that is needed by the core long-sequence GST algorithms, one can also construct, in similar fashion, a list of `pygsti.objects.GateStringStructure` objects.  These objects mimic a list of `GateStrings` in many ways, but retain the structure of each sequence so that per-gate-sequence quantities may later be plotted according to their decomposition into fiducials, germ, and $L$.  The `allstrs` member of a `GateStringStructure` allows access to the underlying list of `GateString` objects.  We'll demonstrate this when we get to plotting.  For now, just think of this as a slightly richer way to generate the sequences needed by a GST algorithm that facilitates post-processing and analysis."
