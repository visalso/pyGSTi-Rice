    Create a set of gate string lists for LSGST based on germs and max-lengths.

    Constructs a series (a list) of gate string lists used by long-sequence GST
    (LSGST) algorithms.  If `includeLGST == True` then the starting list is the
    list of LGST strings, otherwise the starting list is empty.  For each
    nonzero element of maxLengthList, call it L, a list of gate strings is
    created with the form:

    Case: truncScheme == 'whole germ powers':
      prepStr + pygsti.construction.repeat_with_max_length(germ,L) + effectStr

    Case: truncScheme == 'truncated germ powers':
      prepStr + pygsti.construction.repeat_and_truncate(germ,L) + effectStr

    Case: truncScheme == 'length as exponent':
      prepStr + germ^L + effectStr

    If nest == True, the above list is iteratively *added* (w/duplicates
    removed) to the current list of gate strings to form a final list for the
    given L.  This results in successively larger lists, each of which
    contains all the elements of previous-L lists.  If nest == False then
    the above list *is* the final list for the given L.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gateLabelSrc : list or GateSet
        List of gate labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a GateSet,
        then the gate labels are extracted via `gateLabelSrc.gates.keys()`. Only
        relevant when `includeLGST == True`.

    prepStrs : list of GateStrings
        List of the preparation fiducial gate strings, which follow state
        preparation.

    effectStrs : list of GateStrings
        List of the measurement fiducial gate strings, which precede
        measurement.

    germList : list of GateStrings
        List of the germ gate strings.

    maxLengthList : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths. A zero value in this list has special 
        meaning, and corresponds to the LGST sequences.

    fidPairs : list of 2-tuples or dict, optional
        Specifies a subset of all fiducial string pairs (prepStr, effectStr)
        to be used in the gate string lists.  If a list, each element of 
        fidPairs is a (iPrepStr, iEffectStr) 2-tuple of integers, each 
        indexing a string within prepStrs and effectStrs, respectively, so 
        that prepStr = prepStrs[iPrepStr] and effectStr = 
        effectStrs[iEffectStr].  If a dictionary, keys are germs (elements
        of germList) and values are lists of 2-tuples specifying the pairs
        to use for that germ.

    truncScheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means. If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    nest : boolean, optional
        If True, the returned gate string lists are "nested", meaning
        that each successive list of gate strings contains all the gate
        strings found in previous lists (and usually some additional
        new ones).  If False, then the returned string list for maximum
        length == L contains *only* those gate strings specified in the
        description above, and *not* those for previous values of L.

    keepFraction : float, optional
        The fraction of fiducial pairs selected for each germ-power base
        string.  The default includes all fiducial pairs.  Note that
        for each germ-power the selected pairs are *different* random
        sets of all possible pairs (unlike fidPairs, which specifies the
        *same* fiducial pairs for *all* same-germ base strings).  If
        fidPairs is used in conjuction with keepFraction, the pairs
        specified by fidPairs are always selected, and any additional
        pairs are randomly selected.

    keepSeed : int, optional
        The seed used for random fiducial pair selection (only relevant
        when keepFraction < 1).

    includeLGST : boolean, optional
        If true, then the starting list (only applicable when
        `nest == True`) is the list of LGST strings rather than the 
        empty list.  This means that when `nest == True`, the LGST 
        sequences will be included in all the lists.

    germLengthLimits : dict, optional
        A dictionary limiting the max-length values used for specific germs.
        Keys are germ sequences and values are integers.  For example, if
        this argument is `{('Gx',): 4}` and `maxLengthList = [1,2,4,8,16]`,
        then the germ `('Gx',)` is only repeated using max-lengths of 1, 2,
        and 4 (whereas other germs use all the values in `maxLengthList`).


    Returns
    -------
    list of (lists of GateStrings)
        The i-th list corresponds to a gate string list containing repeated
        germs limited to length maxLengthList[i].  If nest == True, then
        repeated germs limited to previous max-lengths are also included.
        Note that a "0" maximum-length corresponds to the LGST strings.

    Create a set of gate string structures for LSGST.

    Constructs a series (a list) of gate string structures used by long-sequence
    GST (LSGST) algorithms.  If `includeLGST == True` then the starting
    structure contains the LGST strings, otherwise the starting structure is
    empty.  For each nonzero element of maxLengthList, call it L, a set of

    Parameters
    ----------
    gateLabelSrc : list or GateSet
        List of gate labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a GateSet,
        then the gate labels are extracted via `gateLabelSrc.gates.keys()`. Only
        relevant when `includeLGST == True`.

    prepStrs : list of GateStrings
        List of the preparation fiducial gate strings, which follow state
        preparation.

    effectStrs : list of GateStrings
        List of the measurement fiducial gate strings, which precede
        measurement.

    germList : list of GateStrings
        List of the germ gate strings.

    maxLengthList : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths. A zero value in this list has special 
        meaning, and corresponds to the LGST sequences.

    fidPairs : list of 2-tuples or dict, optional
        Specifies a subset of all fiducial string pairs (prepStr, effectStr)
        to be used in the gate string lists.  If a list, each element of 
        fidPairs is a (iPrepStr, iEffectStr) 2-tuple of integers, each 
        indexing a string within prepStrs and effectStrs, respectively, so 
        that prepStr = prepStrs[iPrepStr] and effectStr = 
        effectStrs[iEffectStr].  If a dictionary, keys are germs (elements
        of germList) and values are lists of 2-tuples specifying the pairs
        to use for that germ.

    truncScheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means. If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    nest : boolean, optional
        If True, the returned gate string lists are "nested", meaning
        that each successive list of gate strings contains all the gate
        strings found in previous lists (and usually some additional
        new ones).  If False, then the returned string list for maximum
        length == L contains *only* those gate strings specified in the
        description above, and *not* those for previous values of L.

    keepFraction : float, optional
        The fraction of fiducial pairs selected for each germ-power base
        string.  The default includes all fiducial pairs.  Note that
        for each germ-power the selected pairs are *different* random
        sets of all possible pairs (unlike fidPairs, which specifies the
        *same* fiducial pairs for *all* same-germ base strings).  If
        fidPairs is used in conjuction with keepFraction, the pairs
        specified by fidPairs are always selected, and any additional
        pairs are randomly selected.

    keepSeed : int, optional
        The seed used for random fiducial pair selection (only relevant
        when keepFraction < 1).

    includeLGST : boolean, optional
        If true, then the starting list (only applicable when
        `nest == True`) is the list of LGST strings rather than the 
        empty list.  This means that when `nest == True`, the LGST 
        sequences will be included in all the lists.

    gateLabelAliases : dictionary, optional
        Dictionary whose keys are gate label "aliases" and whose values are tuples
        corresponding to what that gate label should be expanded into before querying
        the dataset.  This information is stored within the returned gate string
        structures.  Defaults to the empty dictionary (no aliases defined)
        e.g. gateLabelAliases['Gx^3'] = ('Gx','Gx','Gx')

    sequenceRules : list, optional
        A list of `(find,replace)` 2-tuples which specify string replacement
        rules.  Both `find` and `replace` are tuples of gate labels 
        (or `GateString` objects).

    dscheck : DataSet, optional
        A data set which is checked for each of the generated gate strings. When
        a generated sequence is missing from this `DataSet`, action is taken
        according to `actionIfMissing`.

    actionIfMissing : {"raise","drop"}, optional
        The action to take when a generated gate sequence is missing from
        `dscheck` (only relevant when `dscheck` is not None).  "raise" causes
        a ValueError to be raised; "drop" causes the missing sequences to be
        dropped from the returned set.

    germLengthLimits : dict, optional
        A dictionary limiting the max-length values used for specific germs.
        Keys are germ sequences and values are integers.  For example, if
        this argument is `{('Gx',): 4}` and `maxLengthList = [1,2,4,8,16]`,
        then the germ `('Gx',)` is only repeated using max-lengths of 1, 2,
        and 4 (whereas other germs use all the values in `maxLengthList`).

    verbosity : int, optional
        The level of output to print to stdout.


    Returns
    -------
    list of LsGermsStructure objects
        The i-th object corresponds to a gate string list containing repeated

    Create a list of all the gate strings (i.e. the experiments) required for
    long-sequence GST (LSGST) algorithms.

    Returns a single list containing, without duplicates, all the gate
    strings required throughout all the iterations of LSGST given by
    maxLengthList.  Thus, the returned list is equivalently the list of
    the experiments required to run LSGST using the supplied parameters,
    and so commonly used when construting data set templates or simulated
    data sets.  The breakdown of which gate strings are used for which
    iteration(s) of LSGST is given by make_lsgst_lists(...).

    Parameters
    ----------
    gateLabelSrc : list or GateSet
        List of gate labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a GateSet,
        then the gate labels are extracted via `gateLabelSrc.gates.keys()`. Only
        relevant when `includeLGST == True`.

    prepStrs : list of GateStrings
        List of the preparation fiducial gate strings, which follow state
        preparation.

    effectStrs : list of GateStrings
        List of the measurement fiducial gate strings, which precede
        measurement.

    germList : list of GateStrings
        List of the germ gate strings.

    maxLengthList : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths.

    fidPairs : list of 2-tuples, optional
        Specifies a subset of all fiducial string pairs (prepStr, effectStr)
        to be used in the gate string lists.  If a list, each element of 
        fidPairs is a (iPrepStr, iEffectStr) 2-tuple of integers, each 
        indexing a string within prepStrs and effectStrs, respectively, so 
        that prepStr = prepStrs[iPrepStr] and effectStr = 
        effectStrs[iEffectStr].  If a dictionary, keys are germs (elements
        of germList) and values are lists of 2-tuples specifying the pairs
        to use for that germ.

    truncScheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means. If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    keepFraction : float, optional
        The fraction of fiducial pairs selected for each germ-power base
        string.  The default includes all fiducial pairs.  Note that
        for each germ-power the selected pairs are *different* random
        sets of all possible pairs (unlike fidPairs, which specifies the
        *same* fiduicial pairs for *all* same-germ base strings).  If
        fidPairs is used in conjuction with keepFraction, the pairs
        specified by fidPairs are always selected, and any additional
        pairs are randomly selected.

    keepSeed : int, optional
        The seed used for random fiducial pair selection (only relevant
        when keepFraction < 1).

    includeLGST : boolean, optional
        If true, then ensure that LGST sequences are included in the
        returned list.

    Create a set of gate string lists for eLGST based on germs and max-lengths

    Constructs a series (a list) of gate string lists used by the extended LGST
    (eLGST) algorithm.  If `includeLGST == True` then the starting list is the
    list of length-1 gate label strings, otherwise the starting list is empty.
    For each nonzero element of maxLengthList, call it L, a list of gate strings is
    created with the form:

    Case: truncScheme == 'whole germ powers':

    Case: truncScheme == 'length as exponent':
      germ^L

    If nest == True, the above list is iteratively *added* (w/duplicates
    removed) to the current list of gate strings to form a final list for the
    given L.  This results in successively larger lists, each of which
    contains all the elements of previous-L lists.  If nest == False then
    the above list *is* the final list for the given L.

    ----------
    gateLabelSrc : list or GateSet
        List of gate labels to determine needed LGST strings.  If a GateSet,
        then the gate labels are extracted via `gateLabelSrc.gates.keys()`. Only
        relevant when `includeLGST == True`.

    germList : list of GateStrings
        List of the germ gate strings.

    maxLengthList : list of ints
        List of maximum lengths. A zero value in this list has special 
        meaning, and corresponds to the length-1 gate label strings.

    truncScheme : str, optional
        Truncation scheme used to interpret what the list of maximum lengths
        means.  If unsure, leave as default. Allowed values are:

        - 'whole germ powers' -- germs are repeated an integer number of
          times such that the length is less than or equal to the max.
        - 'truncated germ powers' -- repeated germ string is truncated
          to be exactly equal to the max (partial germ at end is ok).
        - 'length as exponent' -- max. length is instead interpreted
          as the germ exponent (the number of germ repetitions).

    nest : boolean, optional
        If True, the returned gate string lists are "nested", meaning
        that each successive list of gate strings contains all the gate
        strings found in previous lists (and usually some additional
        new ones).  If False, then the returned string list for maximum
        length == L contains *only* those gate strings specified in the
        description above, and *not* those for previous values of L.

    includeLGST : boolean, optional
        If true, then the starting list (only applicable when
        `nest == True`) is the list of length-1 gate label strings
        rather than the empty list.  This means that when
        `nest == True`, the length-1 sequences will be included in all
        the lists.


    Returns
    -------
    list of (lists of GateStrings)
        The i-th list corresponds to a gate string list containing repeated
        germs limited to length maxLengthList[i].  If nest == True, then
        repeated germs limited to previous max-lengths are also included.
        Note that a "0" maximum-length corresponds to the gate
        label strings.
