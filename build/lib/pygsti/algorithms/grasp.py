    Constructs a subset of `elements` that represents a feasible solution.

    This function performs the "greedy-construction" part of a grasp
    iteration (see :func:`do_grasp_iteration`). The returned solution
    subset is built up by repeating the following step until a feasible
    solution (using `feasibleThreshold` OR `feasibleFn`):

    1. Build a candidate list from elements that haven't been chosen.
    2. Based on the scores of the candidates (using `scoreFn`), construct a
       "reduced candidate list" (using `rclFn`) that need not (but could) be
       just the single best-scoring element.
    3. Choose a random element from the reduced candidate list and add it
       to the solution subset.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    elements : list
        A list containing some representation of the elements that can be used

    feasibleThreshold : score
        A value comparable with the return value of the various score functions
