	<h1>Gauge Variant Error Metrics</h1>
	<p>This tab provides a variety of common (and uncommon) error metrics derived from the estimated gate set.  All of these quanties are <q>gauge-dependent</q>, which means two things.  First, they aren't directly physically measurable, so they can't map directly to observable error rates.  Second, they are only as reliable (as diagnostics) inasmuch as pyGSTi is able to pick a sensible gauge (reference frame) in which to report gates.  PyGSTi does this by first finding an estimate based on the data (and ignoring gauge entirely), then varying over all possible representations of those gates (gauges) to minimize a measure of the gates' implausibility (distance from the targets, combined with violation of positivity).  This measure has parameters -- e.g. the weights placed on different gates -- and reports often include multiple "gauge optimizations".  A dropdown menu in the sidebar allows switching between these options, and the parameters used for the currently-shown estimate are shown below it.</p>
