# Input Summary
Information pertaining to the ideal target gate set and data set.

### Ideal SPAM operations.
The *ideal* input state ($\rho_0$) and `plus' POVM effect $E_0$ for the device on which we report.  SPAM gates are given here as $d\times d$ matrices.

### Ideal logic gates
The *ideal* (generally unitary) logic gates.  Each has a name starting with <q>G</q>, and is represented as a $d^2\times d^2$ *superoperator* that acts by matrix multiplication on vectors in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$.  Matrices are displayed using a heat map that ranges between 1.0 (red) and -1.0 (blue).
