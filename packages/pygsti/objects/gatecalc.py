        #   the derivative of the gate matrix elements with respect to the gate parameters (derivWRTParams
        #   is 56x(nGateParams) and dParams_ij is (nGateParams)x1 in the 1Q case) -- then substitute dG_ij
        #   with dParams_ij above to arrive at a (nGateParams)x(nGateParams) projector (compatible with
        #   hessian computed by gateset).

           When not None, an MPI communicator for distributing the computation

        clipTo : 2-tuple, optional
           (min,max) to clip returned probability to if not None.
           Only relevant when returnPr == True.

        check : boolean, optional
          If True, perform extra checks within code to verify correctness,
          generating warnings when checks fail.  Used for testing, and runs
          much slower when True.

        comm : mpi4py.MPI.Comm, optional
           When not None, an MPI communicator for distributing the computation
           across multiple processors.  Distribution is first performed over
           subtrees of evalTree (if it is split), and then over blocks (subsets)
           of the parameters being differentiated with respect to (see
           wrtBlockSize).

        wrtFilter1, wrtFilter2 : list of ints, optional
          If not None, a list of integers specifying which gate set parameters
          to differentiate with respect to in the first (row) and second (col)
          derivative operations, respectively.

        wrtBlockSize2, wrtBlockSize2 : int or float, optional
          The maximum number of 1st (row) and 2nd (col) derivatives to compute
          *products* for simultaneously.  None means compute all requested
          rows or columns at once.  The  minimum of wrtBlockSize and the size
          that makes maximal use of available processors is used as the final
          block size.  These arguments must be None if the corresponding
          wrtFilter is not None.  Set this to non-None to reduce amount of
          intermediate memory required.

        Constructs a generator that computes the 2nd derivatives of the
        probabilities generated by a each gate sequence given by evalTree
        column-by-column.

        This routine can be useful when memory constraints make constructing
        the entire Hessian at once impractical, and one is able to compute
        reduce results from a single column of the Hessian at a time.  For
        example, the Hessian of a function of many gate sequence probabilities
        can often be computed column-by-column from the using the columns of
        the gate sequences.


        Parameters
        ----------
        spam_label_rows : dictionary
            a dictionary with keys == spam labels and values which
            are integer row indices into mxToFill, specifying the
            correspondence between rows of mxToFill and spam labels.

        evalTree : EvalTree
            given by a prior call to bulk_evaltree.  Specifies the gate strings
            to compute the bulk operation on.  This tree *cannot* be split.

        wrtSlicesList : list
            A list of `(rowSlice,colSlice)` 2-tuples, each of which specify
            a "block" of the Hessian to compute.  Iterating over the output
            of this function iterates over these computed blocks, in the order
            given by `wrtSlicesList`.  `rowSlice` and `colSlice` must by Python
            `slice` objects.

        bReturnDProbs12 : boolean, optional
           If true, the generator computes a 2-tuple: (hessian_col, d12_col),
           where d12_col is a column of the matrix d12 defined by:
           d12[iSpamLabel,iGateStr,p1,p2] = dP/d(p1)*dP/d(p2) where P is is
           the probability generated by the sequence and spam label indexed
           by iGateStr and iSpamLabel.  d12 has the same dimensions as the
           Hessian, and turns out to be useful when computing the Hessian
           of functions of the probabilities.

        comm : mpi4py.MPI.Comm, optional
           When not None, an MPI communicator for distributing the computation
           across multiple processors.  Distribution is performed as in
           bulk_product, bulk_dproduct, and bulk_hproduct.


        Returns
        -------
        block_generator
          A generator which, when iterated, yields the 3-tuple 
          `(rowSlice, colSlice, hprobs)` or `(rowSlice, colSlice, dprobs12)`
          (the latter if `bReturnDProbs12 == True`).  `rowSlice` and `colSlice`
          are slices directly from `wrtSlicesList`. `hprobs` and `dprobs12` are
          arrays of shape K x S x B x B', where:

          - K is the length of spam_label_rows,
          - S is the number of gate strings (i.e. evalTree.num_final_strings()),
          - B is the number of parameter rows (the length of rowSlice)
          - B' is the number of parameter columns (the length of colSlice)

          If `mx`, `dp1`, and `dp2` are the outputs of :func:`bulk_fill_hprobs`
          (i.e. args `mxToFill`, `deriv1MxToFill`, and `deriv1MxToFill`), then:

        itemWeights : dict, optional

           can be gate, state preparation, POVM effect, or spam labels, as well

           of the gate or SPAM elements, respectively (but are overridden by

        Compute the diamond-norm distance between two
        gatesets, defined as the maximum
        of the diamond-norm distances between each
        corresponding gate, including spam gates.

        Parameters
        ----------
        otherCalc : GateCalc
            the other gate calculator to difference against.

        transformMx : numpy array, optional
            if not None, transform this gateset by
            G => inv(transformMx) * G * transformMx, for each gate matrix G

            This transformation is applied only for the difference and does
