# System and pyGSTi parameters
This section contains a raw dump of system information and various pyGSTi parameters.  It's purpose is to stamp this report with parameters indicating how exactly GST was run to create it, as well as to record the software environment in within which the report creation was run.  Note that if the core GST computation was done on a machine different from the one that created this report, the software information contained here will be of less value.
