	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Fiducial circuits</span> <span class="captiondetail">  A list of the preparation and measurement <q>fiducial</q> circuits. These circuits precede and follow, respectively, the potentially long germ-to-some-power portion of GST gate sequences, and generate informationally complete input/output ensembles from the native state preparation[s] and measurement. </span></figcaption>

	<figure id="germListTable" class='tbl'>
	  <figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Germs</span> <span class="captiondetail"> A list of the <q>germ</q> circuits used in this experiment.  Germs are relatively short circuits that get repeated (perhaps many times) in order to amplify various types of qubit errors.  The list of germs is often chosen so that <i>all</i> possible types of in-model errors are amplified by <i>at least one</i> germ.  Note: it's generally impossible to find a single germ that amplifies all possible errors, except when the gate being studied is the identity operation.</span></figcaption>
